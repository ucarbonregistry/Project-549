Aaditiya Aswin Paper Mills Private Limited operates an integrated Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) within
its paper manufacturing facility located in Sathyamangalam, Tamil Nadu. The plant is designed to manage
and treat effluent generated from its 100% recycled paper production process, ensuring environmentally
responsible water management in line with industry best practices.
The project owner holds exclusive water user rights within the project boundary and possesses
undisputed legal title to the land on which the ETP is established. These entitlements enable the company
to independently manage water intake, effluent treatment, and reuse infrastructure. The project is
situated within the company’s industrial premises, enabling streamlined operations and regulatory
compliance.

With a total capital investment estimated between ₹12 to ₹20 Crores, the project encompasses key
components such as design, construction, advanced treatment technology installation, commissioning,
and environmental permitting. The company has either secured or applied for all necessary statutory
approvals including those mandated by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board ensuring adherence to
the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act and other applicable environmental laws.
This initiative represents a long-term commitment to sustainable industrial operations through the
treatment and reuse of effluent water. By integrating closed-loop practices and advanced effluent
management, Aaditiya Aswin Paper Mills Private Limited demonstrates environmental stewardship
aligned with both national regulations and global sustainability goals.

Aaditiya Aswin Paper Mills Private Limited has implemented an effluent treatment strategy that directly
supports local and onsite water security by reducing freshwater dependency and promoting reuse within
the facility. The installation of an on-site Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP), along with designated solar
evaporation pans for boiler blow-down, ensures controlled management of trade effluent and aligns with
Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) discharge regulations.

Although no formal artificial recharge structures such as percolation ponds, injection wells, or recharge
shafts have been installed to date, the facility’s treated effluent reuse system indirectly contributes to
water security by minimizing groundwater abstraction. Out of the total 745 KLD of process effluent
generated, approximately 585 KLD is recycled internally without treatment, and the remaining 160 KLD is
treated in the ETP and then applied on land for irrigation within the facility’s premises. This land
application not only supports greenbelt development but may also aid in incidental aquifer recharge
through sub-surface infiltration, depending on local soil permeability.

In future phases, the company plans to enhance water conservation by integrating rooftop rainwater
harvesting systems and evaluating the feasibility of constructing dedicated artificial recharge structures
such as percolation pits or recharge trenches. These measures would supplement the groundwater table,
especially in light of the declining aquifer status observed in the Sathyamangalam region.
